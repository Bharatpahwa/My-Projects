            The computer picks a secret number between 1 and 20 , and then tells
            the guesser to start guessing. The guesser should guess one number
            and click on check button. If the guess was too high, the computer
            should say "too high". The guesser can use previous guesses to help
            them with the next one. If the guess was too low, the chooser should
            say "too low". The guesser keeps making guesses and getting replies
            until they guess right. Highscore will Keep a count of the number of
            guesses it took to get to the secret number. to play again simply
            click on "Again" button , and have another go.

            Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is
            rolled or the player decides to "hold": If the player rolls a 1,
            they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn. If the
            player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and
            the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to "hold", their
            turn total is added to their hignscore, and it becomes the next
            player's turn. The first player to score 50 or more points wins. For
            example, the first player, Rahul, begins a turn with a roll of 5.
            Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again.
            Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but
            chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn
            without scoring. The next player, Neha , rolls the sequence
            4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total
            of 23 points to her score.
